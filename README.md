# crop-prediction
I have successfully completed crop prediction using ensemble model by using Machine Learning models ,which are most popular in the market.
I'm pleased to announce that I've accomplished the crop prediction task utilizing an ensemble model in machine learning. This ensemble included algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost, resulting in successful predictions.
